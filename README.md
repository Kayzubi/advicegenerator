# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). 

I spiced it up by making the jokes to be read out.
 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Click the die on the page and have a new advice read out to them

### Built with
